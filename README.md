# PasswordGenerator
#### This is the repository for Homework 3, due November 21st, 2020.

### For this assignment, I have edited the original Javascript which was given in order to provide functionality to the password generator. The ways in which I achieved this were:
    * Providing access to user input, allowing each person to choose the number and types of characters their password will contain.
        * This includes providing error specific feedback, so that the user will know what information was submitted incorrectly.
    * Changing the information that would be added to the array containing possible characters for the password, based on the user's input. 
    * Using a randomization function to select the correct number of characters.
        * The characters are added one at a time, and this process is illustrated within the console.
    * Finally, the user receives their password.
